        /* This is the key part of this demo.  How are we going to randomly reorder elements of a collection? 
           I've read that using the SQL engine (with multiselect select from TABLE (x) )for ordering is a good 
           idea when the collection is large; but I doubt sorting 12 elements is a large enough task to justify 
           the context switch from PL/SQL to SQL, so I'll do it in PL/SQL loop over a 12 row set generated in SQL.
           Perhaps later I'll add a second SQL based sort function and see how it compares.  
           I've started with nested table collection type.  I wonder though if it might work better with a 
           varray.  I avoided varrays as they are recommended for always sequential access and this will 
           be accessing the source non-sequentially.  However, that recommendation may be because varrays are 
           always dense and nested tables can become sparse, which will not be a factor in this case because 
           our reference decks are unchanging and will always be dense.  */
